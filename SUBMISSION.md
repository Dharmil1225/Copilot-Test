## GitHub Copilot Usage Summary
<!-- Describe how you used AI throughout the test. Be specific about when and how you leveraged AI tools. -->

[First, I used the api_guideline file to explain the proper implementation steps. Then, I reviewed the requirements from the md file and included them in the Copilot prompt. Based on those requirements, I added an additional instruction specifying that the database should not be used, as we will be working with an in-memory database. Finally, I clicked the Send button with the codebase context enabled, so it could analyze all the files and generate the implementation accordingly.

## Key Prompts Used
<!-- List 3-5 important prompts you used with your AI assistant -->

1. ["Create a task management API in Node.js using Express with an in-memory database, including endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks"]
2. [ "Add proper error handling and also add logger for each api endpoint to capture the all steps" ]

- **Decision 1:** [ "Use in-memory database to save the task details" ]
  - **Reasoning:** []

- **Decision 2:** [ "Use class-validator to verify the incoming request and also use the dto patterns for request payload " ]
